// Write  a  C  program  that asks  the  user  to  enter  three  numbers(integres).
// A  menu  will  be displayed to let the user choose one of the three options:
// show the sum of the two highest numbers, product of the three numbers, or the largest of the three numbers.

// Required: Your code must use pointers ONLY!
// Consequently, the function malloc should be used to allocate memory spaces for the userâ€™s input and possibly for other data.

//pre-processor directives
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// Main Function
int main()

	// *pointer1, *pointer2, and *pointer3 represent the values the user enters. *Choice represents which selection (1, 2, or 3)
	// that the user wants to choose

	float *answer;

	// *answer is used for a couple different outcomes ... *answer is used when to find the product of three numbers, to find
	// the answer to *pointer2 / *pointer3, and it is used to find the highest two numbers

	char *option, *keep;

	// *option is used at the end when the user decides if they either want to choose a new set of numbers or to leave the program
	// *keep is used when the user decides to keep the previously set values or to move on to either the end of the program
	// or to choose a new set of numbers

	// This allocates memory for the user's input and other data
	// *malloc is essential*
